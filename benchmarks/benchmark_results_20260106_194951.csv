Below is a Python function named `reverse_string` which takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of it. The function includes type hints for its parameters and return value, along with a detailed docstring.

```python
def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
    """"""
    Reverses the given string without using built-in reverse methods.

    Parameters:
        s (str): The input string to be reversed.

    Returns:
        str: The reversed string.
    """"""

    # Initialize an empty list to hold characters of the reversed string
    reversed_list = []

    # Iterate over the original string in reverse order and append each character to the list
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_list.append(s[i])

    # Join all elements (characters) in the list into a single string
    return ''.join(reversed_list)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    original_string = ""hello""
    print(f""Original: {original_string}"")
    print(f""Reversed: {reverse_string(original_string)}"")
```

This function creates an empty list and iterates over the characters of the input string in reverse order, appending each character to the list. Finally, it joins all elements in the list into a single string using `''.join()` method, which concatenates them without any additional spaces or delimiters.

You can test this function with different inputs to",,,,2026-01-06T19:49:51.762811,
