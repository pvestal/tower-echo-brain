qwen2.5:3b,code_002,Bug fix identification,coding,93.53,2614.62,273,104.41,,11061.0,"The provided function `get_user_by_id` has a logical error where it immediately returns `None` after finding the first matching user, without checking all users in the list. It's important to iterate over all elements in the list to ensure that if no match is found for any given `user_id`, then the function can return `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def get_user_by_id(user_id: int, users: list[dict]) -> dict | None:
    for user in users:
        if user['id'] == user_id:
            return user
    # If no matching user is found, return None
    return None
```

### Explanation of the Changes:

1. **Removed Early Return**: The function previously returned `None` as soon as a match was found during the iteration, which means that if any user matches the given ID, the rest of the list won't be checked.
2. **Added Missing Return Statement**: To ensure that all users are checked and no matching user is found in the entire list, a return statement should be added after exiting the loop to handle the case where no match was found.

Now, the function correctly checks every user in the `users` list before deciding whether or not to return the matched user. If no matching user is found at all, it will finally return `None`.",,,,2026-01-06T19:49:57.820956,
qwen2.5:3b,code_003,Database query optimization,coding,88.37,4107.28,343,83.51,,11061.0,"To improve the performance of the query, we can use SQLAlchemy's eager loading (also known as subqueries or joins), which allows us to fetch related data in a single database round-trip instead of multiple queries.

Here is an optimized version of the function:

```python
from sqlalchemy import func

def get_active_users_with_orders(session):
    # Use a subquery for fetching orders associated with active users.
    order_subquery = session.query(Order).filter(
        Order.user_id == User.id, 
        User.is_active,
    ).subquery()

    # Query the main table to fetch active users and then join them with the
    # pre-fetched data in one query.
    result = (
        session.query(User)
        .filter(User.is_active)
        .outerjoin(order_subquery, order_subquery.c.user_id == User.id)
        .group_by(User.id)
        .with_entities(
            User,
            func.count(order_subquery.c.id).label(""order_count"")
        )
        .all()
    )

    return result
```

### Explanation:
1. **Subquery for Orders**: 
   - The subquery `order_subquery` is created using a filter that selects all orders related to active users (i.e., `Order.user_id == User.id AND User.is_active`). This pre-fetches the relevant data in one query.
   
2. **Query with Join**:
   - We use an outer join (`outerjoin`) between the main table `User` and the subquery `order_subquery`. The condition for the join is that a user's ID should match an order’s associated User ID.

3. **Group By and Count**:
   - Using SQLAlchemy's `group_by`, we group the results by user IDs to ensure each user record appears only once in the result set.
   
4. **Select Specific Columns**:
   - The `with_entities` method is used to specify which columns of interest should be returned: the User object itself and a computed count of orders.

By using this optimized approach, you eliminate the need for multiple queries, leading to improved performance, especially if the database is large or complex.",,,,2026-01-06T19:50:06.473196,
qwen2.5:3b,code_004,Async pattern implementation,coding,91.99,6161.71,482,78.23,,11061.0,"Certainly! Below is an example of how you can create such an async function using `aiohttp` and `asyncio`. The function will handle multiple URLs concurrently, with a configurable timeout per request. It will return results as they complete and gracefully handle individual request failures.

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url, timeout=10):
    try:
        # Set the timeout for this request
        async with session.get(url, timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=timeout)) as response:
            if response.status == 200:
                return await response.text()
            else:
                raise Exception(f""Request failed with status: {response.status}"")
    except aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError:
        # Handle timeout
        print(f""Request to {url} timed out"")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other request errors
        print(f""Failed to fetch data from {url}: {e}"")
        return None

async def fetch_multiple_urls(urls, timeout):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = []
        
        for url in urls:
            task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(session, url, timeout))
            tasks.append(task)
            
        # Run all the tasks concurrently
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        # Filter out None values (failed requests) and sort by URL to maintain order
        valid_results = sorted(filter(lambda x: x is not None, results), key=lambda r: urls[results.index(r)])
        
    return valid_results

# Example usage:
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    urls = [""https://httpbin.org/status/200"", ""https://httpbin.org/status/404"", ""https://invalid-url.com""]
    timeout = 5
    results = asyncio.run(fetch_multiple_urls(urls, timeout))
    
    for url, result in zip(urls, results):
        if isinstance(result, str):  
            print(f""Data from {url}:\n{result}"")
        else:
            print(f""Error fetching data from {url}: {result}"")
```

### Explanation:

1. **fetch_data**: This is an async function that performs a GET request to the specified URL with the given timeout and returns the response text if successful. It also handles different types of exceptions such as `aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError` (timeout) and generic exceptions.

2. **fetch_multiple_urls**: This function constructs an `asyncio.ClientSession`, initializes tasks for each URL, and runs them concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. The results are gathered together into a list, filtered to remove None values (indicating failed requests), sorted by the original URLs, and finally returned.

3. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how you can call `fetch_multiple_urls` with a list of URLs and a timeout value. It prints out successful responses or errors accordingly.

### Notes:
- This example assumes that all your URLs are valid HTTPS endpoints as demonstrated in the `urls` list.
- You may need to adjust this based on more complex requirements, such as different request methods (e.g., POST, PUT) or handling other types of data besides text.",,,,2026-01-06T19:50:19.353220,

In this example, we have a mock `MODEL_CAPABILITIES` dictionary that serves as the database-like structure for model capabilities. The `score_complexity` function and `find_best_model` function perform basic heuristics scoring based on complexity and type matching.
