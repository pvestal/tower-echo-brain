  title: Echo Brain Advanced AI Orchestrator API
  description: |
    Comprehensive API for the Echo Brain system - an advanced AI orchestrator with 24+ models,
    Board of Directors governance, real-time monitoring, and universal testing capabilities.

    ## Features
    - **Model Management**: Full CRUD operations for 24+ Ollama models (1B-70B parameters)
    - **Board of Directors**: Transparent AI decision tracking with governance workflows
    - **Intelligence Escalation**: Dynamic scaling from 1B to 70B parameters based on complexity
    - **Testing Framework**: Universal service testing and debugging capabilities
    - **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket streaming of brain activity and decision processes
    - **Voice Integration**: Complete voice notification system
    - **Conversation Memory**: PostgreSQL persistence with thought stream analysis

    ## Architecture
    The Echo Brain system consolidates multiple AI services into a single intelligent router
    with sophisticated governance and monitoring capabilities.
