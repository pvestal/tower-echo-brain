## Version Scheme

Echo Brain uses semantic versioning: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| MAJOR | Fundamental capability shift (e.g., 0.x = pre-production, 1.0 = self-sustaining) |
| MINOR | Phase completion (new capability online) |
| PATCH | Bug fixes, worker fixes, data corrections within a phase |

### v0.6.0 — Close the Gaps ← CURRENT
**Goal:** Address critical gaps: temporal decay, semantic dedup, adaptive search, knowledge graph traversal, HMLR fact verification pipeline.
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Feb 15, 2026)
**Inspired by:** Competitive analysis of Mem0, Khoj, HMLR, Memento-MCP, and 16 other AI memory systems.

#### Feature 1: Temporal Decay + Confidence Scoring ✅
- [x] `confidence`, `last_accessed`, `access_count` fields on all Qdrant payloads
- [x] Logarithmic decay in retriever (gentler than exponential, floor at 0.2)
- [x] Usage-validated vectors (access_count > 5) exempt from decay
- [x] Fire-and-forget access tracking after every search
- [x] Daily `DecayWorker` for background confidence decay
- [x] One-time `scripts/backfill_confidence.py` for existing vectors

#### Feature 2: Semantic Deduplication ✅
- [x] `src/core/dedup.py` — shared module (check_duplicate, merge_metadata, bump_existing_point)
- [x] Inline dedup check (threshold=0.97) wired into all 5 ingestion paths
- [x] Background `DedupWorker` (threshold=0.98) scans for near-duplicates every 6h
- [x] Merge strategy: keep higher access_count, earliest ingested_at, highest confidence

#### Feature 3: Adaptive Search Weighting ✅
- [x] `QueryType` enum: KEYWORD / CONCEPTUAL / MIXED
- [x] `_classify_query_type()` — regex-based signal detection
- [x] Weight presets: keyword=0.4/0.6, conceptual=0.85/0.15, mixed=0.7/0.3
- [x] `query_type` and `search_weights` returned in retriever response

#### Feature 4: Knowledge Graph + HMLR Pipeline ✅
- [x] `src/core/graph_engine.py` — NetworkX DiGraph over facts + graph_edges
- [x] Lazy loading, incremental refresh, full rebuild every 24h
- [x] `GET /api/echo/graph/related/{entity}`, `/path`, `/neighborhood/{entity}`, `/stats`, `POST /refresh`
- [x] Graph enrichment in retriever: top-5 entities → 1-hop traversal → graph_sources
- [x] `explore_graph` MCP tool for Claude Code integration
- [x] `FactScrubber` worker: cosine similarity + LLM verification of extracted facts (every 2h)
- [x] `Governor` worker: conflict resolution via effective_score (confidence×0.6 + recency×0.4), every 12h
- [x] `governor_decisions` audit table for transparency

## Development Workflow

Changes are made through Claude Code sessions on Tower. Each significant change is tested against the smoke suite and contract tests before committing.

```bash
# Run smoke tests
python3 -m pytest tests/echo_brain_smoke_test.py -v

# Run contract tests
cd contract-tests/consumer && npx vitest run --reporter=verbose

# Build frontend
cd frontend && npm run build
```
