Echo Brain Real ML Implementations

This package will contain real implementations of ML interfaces that interact
with actual ML libraries like Ollama, Qdrant, transformers, etc.

Currently, real implementations are not yet created. When they are implemented,
they should be imported and exported from this module.

Planned implementations:
- OllamaLLM: Real Ollama integration
- QdrantVectorStore: Real Qdrant vector database
- TransformersEmbedding: Hugging Face transformers embeddings
- ComfyUIVision: ComfyUI integration for image processing
