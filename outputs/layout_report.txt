RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Batteries: Use NOCO BT31S trays (x2) from Amazon (~$80 total)
2. Cable lengths confirmed adequate with purchased wire
3. Lynx placement allows easy fuse access from compartment door
4. MPPT positioned for heat dissipation and cable routing
5. All clearances meet or exceed manufacturer minimums

NEXT STEPS:
1. Dry-fit batteries in compartment (verify measurements)
2. Mark mounting positions on compartment floor
3. Install battery trays first
4. Route cables before installing components
5. Install components and secure with hardware
